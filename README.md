# AR-genes-_gnomadv4_database_query-2023
Pipeline to query ClinVar vcf file based list of autosomal recessive genes to identify pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Then query those variants against gnomad v3 database to extract population frequencies for given variants. Then calculate VCF and GCF values based on the input varints.
